# TIC TAC TOE...NAIL?

## Overview

**TIC TAC TOE...NAIL?** is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game with a twist. Instead of the traditional "X" and "O", players use custom images: a nail and a toe. This version of the game also includes a win counter for both players and a draw counter to keep track of tied games.

## Features

- Two-player mode with custom images ("nail" and "toe").
- Counters to track the number of wins for each player and the number of draws.
